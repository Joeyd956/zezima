# 👾 Zezima | Offensive Security Researcher

### 💥 I break things to make the internet safer.

I'm an offensive security researcher and automation builder focused on:
- 🔍 Large-scale recon and real-world exploitation
- 📦 Building high-impact tools like `monster.py` to automate Shodan-based exploitation (Redis, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, DICOM, ICS, FTP, etc.)
- 🧠 Extracting high-value loot: PII, PHI, credentials, misconfigurations, and CVSS-worthy vulnerabilities
- 📫 Reporting responsibly (CISA, Microsoft MSRC, medical vendors, financial orgs)
- 💣 Preparing for **OSCP** and **CRTO** certifications

## 🛠️ Featured Tools

### `monster.py` - Offensive Framework
> Automates everything from scanning → exploitation → loot parsing → severity scoring.

- Redis unauth access, RCE injection (Windows & Linux)
- MongoDB schema + eval + juicy field parsing
- Elasticsearch index dump + ML-based loot scoring
- PACS DICOM patient metadata extraction
- ICS telemetry (fuel, modbus, medical)
- Full automation: Shodan → Extraction → Filtered Loot

🔐 Full source available for vetted reviewers or red team orgs.

## ✍️ Writeups

I specialize in real-world exploit reports with PoCs and CVSS scoring:

- [Redis RCE via Windows Startup File Injection](https://github.com/yourrepo/writeups/redis_rce.md)
- [Exposed DICOM PACS Medical System](https://github.com/yourrepo/writeups/dicom_leak.md)
- [ICS Aviation Jet Fuel System Exposure](https://github.com/yourrepo/writeups/ics_fuel_leak.md)

## 🎯 Goals
- Join Synack Red Team (SRT)
- Earn OSCP & CRTO
- Continue building exploit automation tools that **do all the heavy lifting**
- Expose critical misconfigs before the bad guys do
